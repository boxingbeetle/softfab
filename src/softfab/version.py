# TODO: In the future we should read these from the package metadata using
#       importlib.metadata (Python 3.8) or importlib_metadata (compat package).
#       However, Debian's python3-importlib-metadata isn't packaged for Buster
#       at the moment (not in backports either), so it's probably too early
#       to require it as a dependency.
