# Command Line Interface

The `softfab` command can be used to configure and control your SoftFab Control Center from the command line.

The command line interface is currently limited to setup and user management. It will be expanded over time.

The information on this page can also be accessed on the command line using the `--help` option, for example:

`$ softfab --help`
:   Show the global options and top-level commands.

`$ softfab user --help`
:   List the user management commands.

`$ softfab user add --help`
:   Show the syntax for adding a user.
